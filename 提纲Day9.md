###1.1为什么要学习编程

编程已经应用于教育和工业的各个方面

The problem of teaching object-oriented programming：

Object-oriented programming has, in recent years, become the most influential programming paradigm. It is widely used in education and industry, and almost every university teaches object-orientation somewhere in its curriculum

There are a large number of schools in the world which educate students in the field of Information Technology, where is studding programming languages and their application in various scientific fields. Knowledge of programming languages enable to find well-paying jobs. This is the main reason why this profession is attractive for future students.

### 1.2学习编程的困难

新手学习编程会遇到很多问题

Learning and Teaching Programming: A Review and Discussion：

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/csed.13.2.137.14200

Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the “fragility” of novice knowledge, and so on.

Difficulties in Learning and Teaching Programming—Views of Students and Tutors：

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015362608943

We have conducted a web-based questionnaire on the various concepts and topics of object-oriented programming that students on introductory courses found most difficult to cope with.

A statistical analysis of our results shows that those topics that rely on a clear understanding of pointers and memory-related concepts (such as copy constructors and virtual functions) prove to be the most difficult

On the Development of a Programming Teaching Tool: The Effect of Teaching by Templates on the Learning Process：

https://www.learntechlib.org/p/111545/

One of the major issues related to teaching an introductory programming course is the excessive amount of time spent on the language’s syntax, which leaves little time for developing skills in program design and solution creativity. The wide variation in the students’ backgrounds, coupled with the traditional classroom (one size-fits-all) teaching strategy, and bounded course duration, makes it extremely difficult for an instructor to go beyond adequate syntax coverage, to developing and enhancing the student’s problem solving abilities.



### 1.3现有的编程教学架构

因学生人数过多，检测代码错误比较繁琐耗时，会降低老师上课质量，且不便于处理抄袭

Teaching Programming at Scale
http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2531/paper01.pdf

Beyond considerations about the right choice of teaching content and presentation in lectures, scaling practical parts of courses and the examination and grading to course sizes of around 1,000 students is particularly challenging.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true

A concrete example where we can take advantage of software is in summative assessment through automatic grading. There are many tools for automated grading available for instructors of all levels. Intelligent diagnostic feedback was introduced in the educational community a long time back and it is still a topic of interest for the research community (Gupta & Gupta, [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true#); Hollingsworth, [1960](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true#); Page & Petersen, [1995](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true#); Sijimol & Varghese, [2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true#); Simsek et al., [2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2020.1724769?scroll=top&needAccess=true#)).

Using AI to Teach AI: Lessons from an Online AI Class：

The level of student motivation, engagement and ownership are worth the massive time needed to create and deliver these courses. That said, there are many open issues left to address. With regard to using AI to teach AI, we are still exploring the range of topics that can be addressed by nanotutors, the level of authenticity that can be provided through class projects, as well as the development of virtual teaching assistants can answer automatically some classes of questions on the discussion forums. With regard to online education as a whole, we must continue to explore metrics for ensuring that learning outcomes rival or exceed residential equivalents and represent real value to students.
